# About this CPS-Document

This is the most central document for the MOM, it describes how to go from
a MOM-tree to a rendered font. But, the rules defined in here, and the
expectations made, describe just an arbitrary default.
In fact, to extend the functionality of the MOM, most of the rules in here
must be overridden partially or completely by more *specific* rules from
other files.

This file connects the data produced by the importers with the data expected
by the exporters (standard renderers). If the importer is changed, it may
be that this file becomes invalid. However, this file is probably the best
starting point to learn how the MOM is transformed into fonts.

## Property Descriptions

Each CPS rule for a MOM Node in the following has a comment at the
d top of it, documenting the known/used/common properties for it. This
is the reference for the concepts you will encounter there.

Properties are either set element-by-element to element.properties by the
importer, calculated directly in here via the property value definition.

### Expected Properties

Properties used by the standard renderer (renderers/basic). These properties
are the ones consumed outside of the CPS by the basic rendering process.

Custom rendering code can consume other properties, but the documentation
of these is not the scope of this document.

### Commonly Used Properties

Properties used within the CPS (in here).

### Data Types

The values returned by these properties are validated on read time to
meet their expected data type.

### *default: value* and *mandatory!*

*default* means the reader will use the default value if there is no other
value set for the key. NOTE: if these are set, they must obey the data type
expectation; there's no default to recover from a wrong data type.

*mandatory!* means the key must be present.

A <penstroke> represents a glyph contour by defining a "centerline" via
a list of points <center> from each of which a <left> and a <right> point
extrudes to form a two-dimensional shape.

Each conventional contour with an even number of at least 4 on-curve points
can be converted into a penstroke. However, to make it useful for further
transformations it is important to organize the the source contour in
pair-points along the "stroke-directon".

The terminals of a <penstroke> require some special rules.
